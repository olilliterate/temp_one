It was a very cold winter morning when Simon realised
His music collection was gone!
He started looking in the attic
Then he heard a strange sound
It remiinded him of a song he had heard in his youth
It came from a cracking old radio
Somehow Palpatine returned! But don't worry, Rey saved the day... lol
The End... because Disney doesn't know how to write stories anymore

Like... seriously, could they not have created a better story?!
Rey is a Palpatine... really?????
*Cries in 'Eye-Roll'*
I could go on and on... but I'll spare you.
