It was a very cold winter morning when Simon realised
His music collection was gone!
He started looking in the attic
Then he heard a strange sound
It remiinded him of a song he had heard in his youth
It came from a cracking old radio
Somehow Palpatine returned! But don't worry, Rey saved the day... lol
The End... because Disney doesn't know how to write stories anymore

Like... seriously, could they not have created a better story?!
Rey is a Palpatine... really?????
*Cries in 'Eye-Roll'*
I could go on and on... but I'll spare you.



Okay... I'm  back with more Star Wars
But I won't bore you with the TERRIBLE sequels
(Episode 7 was okay I guess, it was a copy of Episode 4)
But ignoring that *Eye Rolls*
Have I told you about my Cosplays. I literally have my own
Custom Mandalorian Costume, and it is amazing
Not to toot my own horn here, but yeah.
Wow... this is a lot of stuff... okay bye for now 

Jar Jar Binks 4 ever 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
